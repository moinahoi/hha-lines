# HHA-Lines
This project is to provide a simple way of finding out if a certain transportation line is operated by the Hamburger Hochbahn.

# Pre-Requisites
Nothing. No seriously: No build tool needed. It's just vanilla script and basic HTML plus CSS.

# Some usefull features
* The size of the input as well as the actual font size is calculcated based on the innerHeight / innerWidth value of the window. 
* The font-size uses a new `--vhw` unit which is always the lower of the innerHeight / innerWidth value.
