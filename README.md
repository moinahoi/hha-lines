# HHA-Lines

This project is to provide a simple way of finding out if a certain transportation line is operated by the Hamburger Hochbahn.

Color scheme inspired by https://www.hvv-switch.de/

Every line within the operation of the Hamburger Hochbahn is `green` or `red` otherwise.

# Pre-Requisites

Nothing. No seriously: No build tool needed. It's just vanilla script and basic HTML plus CSS.

# Some usefull features

- The size of the input as well as the actual font size is calculcated based on the innerHeight / innerWidth value of the window.
- The font-size uses a new `--vhw` unit which is always the lower of the innerHeight / innerWidth value.

# What's next

- PWA for offline availability
